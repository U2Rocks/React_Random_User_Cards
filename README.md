# React Random User Cards

## Summary

This project is an application that uses the Randomuser.me api to generate randomized user cards in the browser.

## Build Notes

This project uses tailwindcss for styling within the html and axios is used to get data from the API.

### Final comments and notes

The first button click of the app tries to make an empty card and the app is not optimized for mobile and squishes in weird ways sometimes.
